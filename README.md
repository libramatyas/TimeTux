# **TimeTux**

### Free and open source tool to change modified date on __[Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/)__ written in __[C++](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines)__
---
#### How it works
---
 in c++ we use syntax

``` c++
    system("bash")
```
to allow us to execute bash commands from c++
this makes just fancy way of using   
```bash
    touch -d '2 hours ago' file.txt
```


### **Credits**
 - [Czechian](https://github.com/libramatyas) for making the initial script
 - [Linus Torvalds](htpps://github.com/torvalds) for making Linux and this project even existing : )
